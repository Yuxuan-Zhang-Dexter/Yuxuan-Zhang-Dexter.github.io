Built on **LMGame‑Bench**, we maintain two cutting‑edge leaderboards:

1. **Model Leaderboard** – ranks 19 state‑of‑the‑art LLM/VLMs evaluated **without** the agentic harness.  
2. **Agent Leaderboard** – ranks 14 state‑of‑the‑art LLM/VLMs **with** our perception‑memory‑reasoning harness enabled.

Both tables cover gameplay across *Super Mario Bros, Sokoban, 2048, Candy Crush, Tetris,* and *Ace Attorney*.
