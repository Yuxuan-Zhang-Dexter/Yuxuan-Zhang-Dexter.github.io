This repository enables and tests LLM/VLM‑based agents in standardized interactive gaming environments. It offers two main capabilities:

1. **Vanilla evaluation**: Evaluate state‑of‑the‑art models across a diverse suite of video games in a single‑model VLM setting (no gaming harness).  
2. **GamingAgent workflow**: Deploy and evaluate models with our customized gaming harness to improve gameplay performance.
