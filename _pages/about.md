# About Me

Hello, and welcome to my personal website! I am **Yuxuan Zhang**, a passionate data scientist and machine learning enthusiast currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science at the **University of California, San Diego**, with an expected graduation in May 2025. With a perfect 4.0 GPA and advanced coursework in deep learning, machine learning systems, and computational frameworks, I am dedicated to transforming innovative AI solutions into scalable real-world applications.

## My Journey

My academic and professional experiences are rooted in combining cutting-edge technology with meaningful applications. From automating neuron segmentation tasks in brain slice images at the **Maximov Lab, Scripps Research Institute**, to designing scalable pre-training pipelines for large language models (LLMs) at **Hao AI Lab**, I thrive at the intersection of system optimization and machine learning innovation.

Here are some of the highlights of my work:
- **Neuron Reconstruction**: Developed 3D segmentation pipelines, fine-tuned segmentation models, and created web visualization tools to revolutionize neuroscience workflows.
- **LLM Optimization**: Designed data curation pipelines for a 6.9TB dataset and implemented distributed pre-training techniques to improve efficiency and scalability.
- **Benchmarking AI**: Built an adversarial reasoning benchmark using a multi-agent bluffing game to evaluate and analyze LLM performance.

## My Vision

Inspired by my work and research, I aspire to design **scalable and efficient machine learning tools** that bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications. I am particularly drawn to tackling challenges in computational efficiency, high-performance computing, and AI system design.
